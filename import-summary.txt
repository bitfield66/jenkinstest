ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* classes\
* classes\com\
* classes\com\artifex\
* classes\com\artifex\mupdf\
* classes\com\artifex\mupdf\.gitignore
* dexedLibs\
* dexedLibs\android-support-v13-r18-58818a116c4aa92483eb67844e495365.jar
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => PdfViewerAndroid_Offline\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* jni\ => PdfViewerAndroid_Offline\src\main\jni\
* res\ => PdfViewerAndroid_Offline\src\main\res\
* src\ => PdfViewerAndroid_Offline\src\main\java\
* src\com\artifex\mupdf\.gitignore => PdfViewerAndroid_Offline\src\main\resources\com\artifex\mupdf\.gitignore

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
